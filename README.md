Title: SQLite Database Management with Python for Record Sorting and Encoding

Description:
This project involves the creation and management of a SQLite database using Python. The primary goal is to demonstrate the process of creating a database, defining a table structure, inserting data, performing SQL queries, and manipulating the resulting records.

The project starts by creating a SQLite database named "ages.sqlite" and establishing a connection to it using the SQLite3 library in Python. A table named "Ages" is then defined within the database, specifying two columns: "name" (VARCHAR) and "age" (INTEGER).

Subsequently, any existing rows in the "Ages" table are deleted to ensure a clean slate. Following this, a set of sample data is inserted into the table. The provided data includes names and corresponding ages for several individuals.

Once the data is inserted, a SQL query is executed to retrieve the records from the "Ages" table. The query concatenates the "name" and "age" columns, converts the result to a hexadecimal string, and orders the records based on this hexadecimal value.

Finally, the project identifies the first row in the resulting record set and prints its hexadecimal representation. This process demonstrates sorting and encoding techniques in SQL, providing insights into data manipulation and retrieval.

Overall, this project serves as a practical example of database management using SQLite and Python, showcasing basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) along with SQL querying and record manipulation. It also highlights the versatility of Python in interacting with databases for various data processing tasks.
